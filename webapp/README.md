Rough ordering of steps from Course Website

Your work is going to proceed in stages, approximately as follows. We'll do several of these steps in class.

1. Choose and obtain a dataset to work with.
2. Create a prioritized user-oriented feature list.
3. Create mock-ups of your web page structure and its rough appearance.
4. Create a development plan (we'll do this in class).
5. Design and set up a database to hold the data.
6. Design an HTTP-based API given your database and your user (I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to use the term "RESTful", which I find oddly annoying)
7. Implement the API interface
8. Implement an end-to-end system that follows the pattern described in the imdb example above, but without useful queries and results. This will be sort of a database-driven client/server "hello world" application. (See Section 10 "Tracer Bullets" in The Pragmatic Programmer.)
9. Implement and test one feature at a time, according to your development plan. In between stages of this part, you might adjust your development plan to adapt to new understanding of the project. (This phase, one small testable bite at a time, is called iterating (possibly NSFW, depending on where you work).

Overview:
This project will get you beginning experience with quite a few important software technologies, including HTML, HTTP, flask, PostgreSQL, psycopg2 (the most commonly used Python PostgreSQL library), AJAX, JSON, and a little bit of Javascript. In the process of developing this project, we will also discuss user stories, more test-driven development with Python's unittest module, the design of functional and client/server interfaces, automation with Makefiles, documentation, a variety of code construction topics, and undoubtedly other stuff that will come up as we proceed.

This will be a lot to learn over a pretty short time. I'll help you break it down into reasonably bite-sized pieces, so if you keep up-to-date, you'll see the whole thing come together gradually, and you'll have learned a lot of new stuff in the process. This should be fun!
