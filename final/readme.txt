Description:



  Frogger:
  The player will control the frog on the screen who will try to cross to the other side while avoiding being smashed and drowning.  Once it crosses, that spot will be marked and the player will win if they mark all of the spots.

Why is MVC the right choice:
  MVC is the right choice because the model must be viewed by the user and the user must control the frog accordingly. The model will be the board that the frog has to move through. The controller will control the frog. The view will allow the user to see the board, the frog, and the obstacles.





Core classes that make up our model:



  Controller, View, Model, and Main
