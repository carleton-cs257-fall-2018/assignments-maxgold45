# assignments-maxgold45

This was a homework project I worked on with Daniel Busis @mydan123 for CS257.
We utilized PyUnit to test a small database of books and authors in a csv format.
Throughout this assignment we became more comfortable with git version-control and bash in a Windows subsystem for Linux.

The three parts of the assignment are each tagged books_phaseN:

books_phase1: http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/courses/cs257_f18/assignments/02_books_phase1.html

books_phase2: http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/courses/cs257_f18/assignments/04_books_phase2.html

books_phase3: http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/courses/cs257_f18/assignments/05_books_phase3.html
