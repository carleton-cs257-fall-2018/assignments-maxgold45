This will be a compilation of my homework assignments from CS257- Software Design. 

"I have two main goals for you in this class.
I want to help you improve your independence as a programmer and your ability to write high quality code.
Pursuing these goals involves the usual academic emphasis on concepts and vocabulary that you need to learn through study and
experimentation. But it also involves lots of practice with the tools of the trade, and lots of effort to develop good habits
and discard bad ones. Therefore, we'll spend a lot of class time on practice." - Jeff Ondich, CS Professor, on the Course Webpage
